# This is a udev file for MCP2200 USB device which changes the permissions
# to 0666 (world readable/writable) on Linux systems.

# If you are using the libusb implementation of hidapi (hid-libusb.c), then
# use something like the following line, substituting the VID and PID with
# those of your device. Note that for kernels before 2.6.24, you will need
# to substitute "usb" with "usb_device". It shouldn't hurt to use two lines
# (one each way) for compatibility with older systems.

# libusb
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="00de", MODE="0666"

# Once done, optionally rename this file for your device, and drop it into
# /etc/udev/rules.d and unplug and re-plug your device. This is all that is
# necessary to see the new permissions. Udev does not have to be restarted.

# Note that the hexadecimal values for VID and PID are case sensitive and
# must be lower case.

# If you think permissions of 0666 are too loose, then see:
# http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html for more information on finer
# grained permission setting. For example, it might be sufficient to just
# set the group or user owner for specific devices (for example the plugdev
# group on some systems).
